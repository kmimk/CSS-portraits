"There are others we can create with CSS, but most things can be simplified to some combination of these shapes. And these are the easiest to create and manipulate." *@lynnandtonic*


#### Square
 ` #square {`  
      `width: 100px;`  
      `height: 100px;`  
      `background: red;`  
    `}`  

#### Rectangle
`#rectangle {`  
  `width: 200px;`  
  `height: 100px;`  
  `background: red;`  
`}`  

#### Circle
`#circle {`  
  `width: 100px;`  
  `height: 100px;`  
  `background: red;`  
  `border-radius: 50%`  
`}`  


#### Oval
`#oval {`  
  `width: 200px;`  
  `height: 100px;`  
  `background: red;`  
  `border-radius: 100px / 50px;`  
`}`  

#### Triangle
`#triangle-up {`  
  `width: 0;`  
  `height: 0;`  
  `border-left: 50px solid transparent;`

  `border-bottom: 100px solid red;`  
`}`

## Multiples of the same shape using box-shadows
With multiple box-shadows, we can create many versions of the same shape in varying size, color, and blur. Offsetting them on the x- and y-axes gives us almost endless multiples.

<img src="/imgs/multiplyshape.png" alt="Multipy shapes from one" height="200" />

`div {  
    box-shadow: 170px 0 10px yellow,  
                330px 0 0 -20px blue,  
                330px 5px 5px -20px black;  
}`

We can even give our box-shadows box-shadows. <b>Pay attention to the order they are declared.</b> 
Again, It‚Äôs helpful to think of them as layers.
