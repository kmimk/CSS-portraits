# Pseudo elements
With one div in the HTML, I actually have three elements to work with because of CSS pseudo classes. 
So with div, div:before, and div:after, we can get something like this:

### pseudo elements

  `div { background: red; }`  
  `div:before { background: yellow; }`  
  `div:after { background: blue; }`  
  
  
It helps to think about these three elements as things that can come in sequence and as three stackable layers. 
So in my mind, it would usually look more like this:

With CSS and one element, we are afforded three basic shape types. We can use width and height properties to create squares/rectangles, border-radius to create circles/ellipses, and border to create triangles/trapezoids.

### Gradients

Gradients can be used to add shading and depth by implying a light source. This makes the simple, flat shapes feel more realistic. 
Combining multiple background-images allows us to use many, layered gradients to achieve more complex shading and even more shapes.
